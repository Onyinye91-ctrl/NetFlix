### NetFlix

# Data Description
Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms with over **8000 movie and tv shows** available in their platform, also with over **800m subscribers**. This project aims to provide insight into Netflix dataset from **2008 – 2020**. The dataset contains **6234 rows** and **12 columns**.

* **Show_id** – unique id for the show
* **Type** – type of show eg movie, tv show
* **Title** – title of the show
* **Director** – name of director for the show
* **Cast** – show cast
* **Country** – countries where this show is viewed
* **Date_added** – the date when the tv and movie show was added to Netflix
* **Release_year** – release year for the tv and movie show
* **Rating** – tv and movie show rating
* **Duration** - duration for the tv and movie show in minutes and season
* **Listed_in** – the category where the tv and movie show is listed
* **Description** – description of the tv and movie show

For my analysis I used **Tableau Public** (a free platform to explore, create and publicly share data visualizations online). More about Tableau Public can be found [Here](https://www.tableau.com/products/public).

## Data Transformation
The data was cleaned, so there was no need for data transformation. The only transformation done was filtering the null value in date_added.
The bussiness insights i looked out for are below:
* Total Movie and TV Shows by Year and Country
* Top 10 TV Shows
* Movie and TV Shows by type, and rating
* Created filters on Movie and TV Shows description, date added, duration, genre (listed_in), rating, and release_year.

In summary, I looked at how users interact with the platform and their preferences regarding tv shows and movie shows. Also, countries with the highest interaction…United State.
